## More on the Project

<p>
I originally made this as a simple extension that adds a button to convert all of the assignments and quizzes into savable ics files, though found there were other things I wanted to improve on Learn as well.
I have plans of making this open source in the future, so if you want to add or have an idea, let me know.

<!-- Installation Guide -->
## Installation Guide
Before looking into your specific browser, go to "Releases" and install the latest version of the zip file for this project. Afterwards, unzip it to somewhere where you can find it.

<h3>Chrome</h3>
To add this addon to chrome, first go to your browser and search "chrome://extensions/". Once there, if you have not already enable developer mode in the top right.
Once you have developer mode enabled, click "Load unpacked" in the top left, and navigate to the unzipped folder where you stored this extension. Import the folder and enable it, then enjoy a better Learn experience!

<h3>Firefox</h3>
If you are on firefox, go to your browser and search "about:debugging". Once here, click on "This Firefox", then click "Load Temporary Add-on...". Navigate to where you unzipped the folder, and double click on "manifest.json" and enable your extension.
A note specific to firefox is that temporary extensions will delete themselves when you close the browser, so if you want to use this, you'll have to add it back again manually each time.

<h3>Other</h3>
If you are on another browser, follow the steps for that particular browser to install an extension.
